				<h1>About Us</h1>
				<p>The dream for CCW came about during the 5th year of a Young Families Bible Study held in wellington that grew from 3 families in 2018 to 15 Adults and 11 Children strong in 2023. Meeting every week to explore Gods written word - a family was born.<br></p>
				<p>The need to settle in a church closer to home and become part of a broader wellington community rooted in a Bible based church became a stronger desire for many. It became evident that Wellington as a community needed a multicultural, Bible based church to call their own. As a result the inspiration for CCW was born and using a WhatsApp group and everyoneâ€™s individual talents a plan to make the church a reality began.<br></p>
				<p>
				CCW falls within the Reach SA denomination which believes 'Gods word above everything'. ReachSA exists to bring the good news of Jesus Christ to all people in South Africa. Their goal is to establish a church in every community in our country. The ReachSA mission is to teach the gospel of Christ and through that Gospel to see communities transformed to the glory of God.<br>With the generosity and openness of Hugenote College the first CCW service will be held on 4 June 2023 at Hugenote College, Kollege Street, Wellington. <br>At CCW you will learn about Gods word, his message and how it applies to us today. Together we will explore His message, His sacrifice and His love. Everyone is welcome.
